## Frequency of Nucelotides in Human Chromosome 1

The number and frequency of each of the nucleotides is as following in a chromosome 1 of homo sapiens:

```
Number of each Nucleotide:
  Adenine  = 65570891
  Cytosine = 47024414
  Guanine  = 47016563
  Thymine  = 65668756
  
Frequency of each Nucleotide:
  A: 29.106%
  C: 20.874%
  T: 29.15%
  G: 20.87%
  
```

As can be noticed in the result the number and frequency of these nucleotides is **NOT** fairly distributed between all 4 nucleotides!

And as we know DNA is a stranded pair of nucleotides sequence and usually in DNA A is paired with T (Thymine) and C (Cytosine) is paired with G(Guanine) and the following is the number of these pairs and their frequency again in homo sapiens chromosome 1:

```
A:T -> 131239647
C:G -> 94040977

A:T -> 58.256%
C:G -> 41.744%

```

Also as you can see in the result the number of *A:T* pairs is way more than the number of *C:G* pairs!
